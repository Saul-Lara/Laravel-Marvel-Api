## Laravel Marvel Api

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

## :rocket: Built With

```
 :page_facing_up: Laravel
```

##  :wrench: Setup

Clone this :open_file_folder:repository on your desktop.

## :computer: How to use?
